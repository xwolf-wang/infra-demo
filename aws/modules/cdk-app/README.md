# Demo Cloud Development Kit app

This is a simple example application that uses the [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) to create an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, along with a corresponding test.


## Usage

1. Build the app with `npm run build`
2. Run the test with `npm run test`
3. Deploy the stack using your default AWS configuration with `cdk deploy`
4. Clean up the stack with `cdk destroy`
